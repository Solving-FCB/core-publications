    "title": "Making the case for gender-inclusive fisheries governance, policies and climate adaptation",
    "abstract": "Gender equality has been a key consideration for policymakers and natural resource managers in assessing climate risk and developing effective adaptation strategies. However, the interests and concerns of women in relation to climate-related planning and fisheries policies are often neglected. This underrepresentation of women, particularly from developing countries, poses a risk of overlooking opportunities to support vulnerable fishing communities. Additionally, it inadvertently increases the vulnerability of marginalized women fisherfolk. This paper reviews 122 refereed publications on the empowerment of local fishing communities, gender participation in fisheries governance, development, and the need to consider gender dimensions in climate adaptation programs worldwide. It highlights the socio-economic impacts of climate change on livelihood and discusses potential adaptation measures. The findings support the adoption of frameworks and policies that provide alternative metrics for women's empowerment, inclusion in fisheries governance, and climate adaptation strategies. The study also offers recommendations for governments, non-governmental organizations, and development agencies responsible for fisheries governance and climate adaptation initiatives.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the effects of anthropogenic activities on Sardinella maderensis fisheries in the coastal areas of Ibeju-Lekki, Lagos, Nigeria. Employing a mixed-method approach, the research included species identification, water quality analysis, land-use change analysis, field surveys, focus group discussions, and interviews. Findings revealed significant urban and industrial land use increase by 175% over four decades, correlating with a decline in catch per unit effort (CPUE) of S. maderensis. Water samples indicated heavy metal levels above international limits and high total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) pollution. The study underscores the need for inclusive coastal management policies to support resilient artisanal fisheries.",

    "abstract": "Aquaculture has the potential to support a sustainable and equitable food system in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) on food security, climate change, and biodiversity (FCB). Biological diversity amongst aquaculture organisms can drive diverse contributions to such goals. Existing studies have assessed the performance of a limited number of taxa in the general context of improving aquaculture production, but few explicitly consider the biological attributes of farmed aquatic taxa at the FCB nexus. Through a systematic literature review, we identify key traits associated with FCB and evaluate the potential of aquaculture to contribute to FCB goals using a fuzzy logic model. The majority of identified traits are associated with food security, and two-thirds of traits linked with food security are also associated with climate change or biodiversity, revealing potential co-benefits of optimizing a single trait. Correlations between FCB indices further suggest that challenges and opportunities in aquaculture are intertwined across FCB goals, but low mean FCB scores suggest that the focus of aquaculture research and development on food production is insufficient to address food security, much less climate or biodiversity issues. As expected, production-maximizing traits (absolute fecundity, the von Bertalanffy growth function coefficient K, macronutrient density, maximum size, and trophic level as a proxy for feed efficiency) highly influence a species\u2019 FCB potential, but so do species preferences for environmental conditions (tolerance to phosphates, nitrates, and pH levels, as well as latitudinal and geographic ranges). Many highly farmed species that are typically associated with food security, especially finfish, score poorly for food, climate, and biodiversity potential. Algae and mollusc species tend to perform well across FCB indices, revealing the importance of non-fish species in achieving FCB goals and potential synergies in integrated multi-trophic aquaculture systems. Overall, this study provides decision-makers with a biologically informed assessment of desirable aquaculture traits and species while illuminating possible strategies to increase support for FCB goals. Our findings can be used as a foundation for studying the socio-economic opportunities and barriers for aquaculture transitions to develop equitable pathways toward FCB-positive aquaculture across nuanced regional contexts.",

    "abstract": "Climate change impacts have been particularly acute and rapid in the Arctic, raising concerns about the conservation of key ecologically and culturally significant species (e.g. beluga whales, Arctic cod), with consequences for the Indigenous community groups in the region. Here, we build on an Ecopath with Ecosim model for the Canadian Beaufort Sea Shelf and Slope to examine historical (1970\u20132021) changes in the ecological dynamics of the food web and key species under climate change. We compare the individual and cumulative effects of (i) increased sea surface temperature; (ii) reduced sea ice extent; (iii) ocean deoxygenation; and (iv) changing ocean salinity in the ecosystem models. We found that including salinity time series in our ecosystem models reduced the diversity found within the ecosystem, and altered the trophic levels, biomass, and consumption rates of some marine mammal and fish functional groups, including the key species: beluga whales, as well as Arctic and polar cods. Inclusion of the dissolved oxygen time series showed no difference to ecosystem indicators. The model findings reveal valuable insights into the attribution of temperature and salinity on Arctic ecosystems and highlight important factors to be considered to ensure that existing conservation measures can support climate adaptation.",

A remarkable advancement of this Agreement is a clear recognition of the need to address the impacts of climate change on marine ecosystems and biodiversity. This comment presents a cautiously optimistic view that the new legal instrument may pave the foundation for global and regional climate action for protecting marine biodiversity in a changing climate. Climate action can be integrated into area-based measures for the conservation of marine ecosystems, including the establishment of high seas marine protected areas. The Agreement also created a legal obligation to consider climate change in the process of environmental impact assessment of activities on the high seas. Therefore, this Agreement is a unique addition and reform to the international law of the sea. However, the success of the Agreement will largely depend on the widespread ratification of states and effective implementation at the regional level.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study is to examine the potential cardiovascular risk of climate-related declines in seafood consumption among First Nations in British Columbia by assessing the combined effects of reduced omega-3 fatty acids and mercury intake from seafood on the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) in 2050 relative to 2009. The data were derived from the First Nations Food, Nutrition, and Environment Study. Seafood consumption among 369 randomly selected participants was estimated, and hair mercury concentrations were measured. Declines in seafood consumption were modelled based on previously projected climate change scenarios, and the associated changes in nutrients and contaminants were used to estimate the cardiovascular risk. Reduced seafood consumption was projected to increase the risk of MI by 4.5%\u20136.5% among older individuals (\u226550 years), by 1.9%\u20132.6% in men, and by 1.3%\u20131.8% in women under lower and upper climate change scenarios, respectively. Reduced seafood consumption may have profound cardiovascular implications. Effective strategies are needed to promote sustainable seafood harvests and access to seafood for coastal First Nations. ",

    "abstract": "There is an urgent need for models that can robustly detect past and\nproject future ecosystem changes and risks to the services that they\nprovide to people. The Fisheries and Marine Ecosystem Model\nIntercomparison Project (FishMIP) was established to develop model\nensembles for projecting long-term impacts of climate change on\nfisheries and marine ecosystems while informing policy at\nspatio-temporal scales relevant to the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model\nIntercomparison Project (ISIMIP) framework. While contributing FishMIP\nmodels have improved over time, large uncertainties in projections\nremain, particularly in coastal and shelf seas where most of the world\u2019s\nfisheries occur. Furthermore, previous FishMIP climate impact\nprojections have mostly ignored fishing activity due to a lack of\nstandardized historical and scenario-based human activity forcing and\nuneven capabilities to dynamically model fisheries across the FishMIP\ncommunity. This, in addition to underrepresentation of coastal\nprocesses, has limited the ability to evaluate the FishMIP ensemble\u2019s\nability to adequately capture past states - a crucial step for building\nconfidence in future projections. To address these issues, we have\ndeveloped two parallel simulation experiments (FishMIP 2.0) on: 1) model\nevaluation and detection of past changes and 2) future scenarios and\nprojections. Key advances include historical climate forcing, that\ncaptures oceanographic features not previously resolved, and\nstandardized fishing forcing to systematically test fishing effects\nacross models. FishMIP 2.0 is a key step towards a detection and\nattribution framework for marine ecosystem change at regional and global\nscales, and towards enhanced policy relevance through increased\nconfidence in future ensemble projections.",

    "abstract": "Climate changes are posing remarkable impacts on marine fish and fisheries. Although many studies have addressed the distributional effects of climate change on single fish species or taxa in recent years, comparative studies focusing on different types of fish are still lacking. In this study, we applied dynamic bioclimate envelop models (DBEM), based on three earth system models, to predict sea surface and bottom temperature, as well as the spatial and temporal distribution of nine representative fishes in the Yellow Sea, contain two habitats, i.e., continental shelf benthopelagic (CBD) and continental shelf pelagic-neritic (CPN) fishes, and two thermophilies, i.e., warm temperate (WT) and warm water (WW) fishes. Under a low emissions scenario (RCP 2.6) and a high emissions scenario (RCP 8.5) between 1970 and 2060, results reveal that: a) CPN fishes show a distinct tendency to move to higher latitudes than CBD fishes, and WW fishes show a significant tendency to migrate more widely to the north than WT fishes; b) The relative abundance of CPN fishes is expected to be higher than that of CBD fishes, while there is no apparent difference in relative abundance between WW fishes and WT fishes. The main reasons for this difference are presumed to be: variance of temperature rise between the sea surface and bottom layers, divergent adaptations of the species, and disparate degrees of anthropogenic influence.",

    "abstract": "Marine algae, both macro and micro, have gained increasing attention for their numerous ecosystem service functions, such as food and raw materials provision and climate change mitigation. Currently, the practice of large-scale algae farming is limited to Asian waters, but significant interest has arisen from other continents. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the areas with suitable environmental conditions for expanding algae farming on a global scale. Previous studies have primarily focused on nutrient availability and thermal constraints when assessing the potential for algae culture. This study uses species distribution models based on an ensemble consensus approach to determine the extent of suitable areas and takes into account multiple environmental factors that may affect the feasibility of algae culture. Our results show that approximately 20.8 million km2 of the ocean (\u223c13.8% of the economic exclusive zones) is suitable for farming marine algae species, with most potential areas located near the coastline. Surprisingly, four out of the top five countries with the largest area suitable for seaweed farming, including Australia, Russia, Canada, and the US, account for 30% of the total suitable areas, yet they currently produce less than 1% of the global seaweed. Several species show promising characteristics for large-scale cultivation, but their viability for commercial production remains uncertain and subject to further assessment of economic feasibility and social acceptance. Further research on the ecological benefits of seaweed farming could also promote the development of an ecologically friendly and financially viable algae mariculture industry. This study provides a scientific basis for decision-makers to understand potential expansion areas and feasible pathways for seaweed farming, with the ultimate goal of ensuring the sustainable utilization of marine resources.",

    "title": "WTO must complete an ambitious fisheries subsidies agreement",
    "abstract": "In June 2022, the World Trade Organization (WTO) reached a landmark agreement on fisheries subsidies, a move strongly supported by the global scientific community. This agreement introduces the first binding global rules requiring governments to assess the legality and sustainability of subsidized fishing activities. Harmful subsidies are a key driver of overfishing, which threatens ocean biodiversity, increases CO\u2082 emissions, and jeopardizes coastal livelihoods and food security. Trade ministers also committed to ongoing negotiations to address unresolved issues, including reducing subsidies that contribute to overcapacity and unfair exploitation. Eliminating harmful subsidies will support the recovery of fish populations, leading to more sustainable catches, improved fisher incomes, and lower carbon emissions. With a ministerial meeting scheduled for February 2024, WTO members have a critical opportunity to adopt stronger regulations that reflect a global commitment to sustainability and equitable trade. We, a coalition of scientists from all inhabited continents, call on the WTO to finalize an ambitious second round of negotiations that prioritizes both environmental and social equity.",

    "abstract": "MODC reflects the overall average oxygen demand level of the community. AGIC, the ratio of habitat oxygen supply to community average demand, reflects habitat viability. Seasonal differences in the Yangtze Estuary\u2019s environment and community structure are significant, without notable interannual changes. The habitat viability in the southern region of the Yangtze Estuary is lower than in the northern region. Hypoxia-driven massive outbreaks ofHarpadon nehereusand jellyfish occurred.AbstractTemperature and oxygen are fundamental environmental factors shaping community structure and are major climatic stressors for marine species globally, interacting with physiological traits of species to establish marine habitats. Periodic seasonal fluctuations in temperature and oxygen significantly influence the composition of community structures and biogeographic habitat viability. This study utilized two community-based indices, the Aerobic Growth Index of the Community (AGIC) and the Mean Oxygen Demand of the Community (MODC), to understand the roles of temperature and oxygen in shaping the community structure of benthic fish and invertebrates during the spring and autumn in the Yangtze Estuary and quantified habitat viability across different seasonal and spatial regions. We observed pronounced seasonal differences in the environmental and community structures of the Yangtze Estuary, though variations in habitat viability across seasons were minimal. Autumn communities demonstrated lower vulnerability and higher resilience to hypoxia. Despite this, from 2004 to 2022, the annual fluctuations in temperature, oxygen levels, and habitat viability were minimal, maintaining high levels overall, except in the spring of 2004. Additionally, influenced by the Taiwan Warm Current, the southern region of the Yangtze Estuary exhibited lower habitat viability compared to the northern region. Although AGIC and MODC, as two new ecological indicators, are limited by some uncertainties, it can still provide guidance for future conservation of estuarine ecosystems and sustainable utilization of fishery resources under the ongoing global oxygen crisis.",

    "abstract": "Climate change is causing fish stocks to shift, upending the social-ecological systems that rely on the historic distributions of these stocks and creating or exacerbating fisheries conflicts. The movements of internationally shared stocks betweenExclusive Economic Zones(EEZs) or between EEZs and the high seas are especially concerning because they bring into play a variety of geopolitical factors and equity issues surrounding missing or conflicting regulations of jurisdictional boundary zones. Though many studies have explored the responses to and repercussions of shifting stocks on fisheries management, there is a dearth of interdisciplinarycase studiesthat provide insight into the complexity of conflict formation in shifting transboundary fisheries, and that highlight the initial response stages where inclusion of proactive and cooperative measures can greatly improve a system\u2019s resilience to conflict. Our study helps to fill this gap by drawing on the knowledge of a diverse group of experts to analyze fourcase studieswhere transboundary stock shifts, geopolitical or governance tensions, and uncertainty regarding the future of the marine environment collide. Through synthesis of case study findings, we create a causal model of fishery conflict, within which we highlight factors that may heighten or mitigate the risk of conflict over shifting resources such as complex histories of power imbalance, unequal access to resources, or a lack of consistent and transparent data collection. Cooperation and equitable decision-making processes are recognized as vital components of internationally shared stock management which can promote lasting, effective, and conflict-resilient fisheries.",

    "abstract": "Climate change impacts marine fisheries catches and micronutrient availability. 21st century catches in Pacific Islands, Southeast Asia and Oceania will decrease. Seafood-derived micronutrients in all areas will decline substantially. Micronutrient supply is insufficient even under strong climate change mitigation.AbstractMarine ecosystem functions are affected by climate change impacts such as ocean warming, deoxygenation and acidification. These impacts drive changes in distributions and body size of fish species and directly affect fisheries. Wild-capture fisheries are crucial for providing nutrients, livelihoods, and employment in tropical Southeast Asia and Pacific Island countries, where coastal communities are highly vulnerable to climate change. We examined the impacts of climate change on fish stocks and nutrient availability of seven key micronutrients (calcium, Omega-3 fatty acids, iodine, iron, vitamin A, vitamin B12 and zinc) in Southeast Asia, Pacific Islands, and Oceania (Australia and New Zealand). We combined micronutrient demands by local human populations withSea Around Usreconstructed catch time series and catch projections from a dynamic bioclimate envelope model for the 21st century. The model predicted a decline in the Maximum Catch Potential (MCP) within Exclusive Economic Zones for Oceania, Pacific Islands, and Southeast Asian countries. Under the \u2018strong mitigation\u2019 scenario, catch potential reductions ranged from a decline of 54\u201366\u00a0% in Oceania, 58\u201392\u00a0% in Pacific Islands, and 65\u201386\u00a0% in Southeast Asia by the mid to the end of the 21st century relative to the historical period, respectively. Under the \u2018no-mitigation\u2019 climate scenario, reductions were more severe, with a decline of 55\u201370\u00a0% in Oceania, 66\u201392\u00a0% in Pacific Islands, and 70\u201386\u00a0% in Southeast Asia for the same time periods. Our findings indicate that Australia and New Zealand are unlikely to meet the recommended nutrient intake demand for most micronutrients through their fisheries (not considering trade or aquaculture production), except for iodine and vitamin B12. Pacific Island countries will likely follow the same pattern while Southeast Asia is expected to face worsening deficits, except for iodine and vitamin B12. This study highlights the importance of incorporating nutritional considerations of seafood into national food, trade and economic policies.Graphical abstractDownload:Download high-res image (604KB)Download:Download full-size image",

    "title": "Transforming towards what? A review of futures-thinking applied in the quest for navigating sustainability transformations",
    "abstract": "There is a growing call for transformations to remain within safe and just Earth system boundaries. Coherent visions of desired futures can help motivate and orient such transformations towards Sustainability, but the nature of these transformed futures is not well understood. This gap has inspired a growing body of research on \u2018preferable\u2019 or \u2018desirable\u2019 futures, which can help to unpack what endpoints such transformations to sustainability could entail and what is needed to get there. In this paper, we adopt a mixed methods approach to review the research literature focused on transformative futures so as to gain a general overview of the field and then undertake two qualitative analyses: i) unpacking the methods, terms and types of outputs produced; and ii) capturing emergent themes, commonalities and divergences in what is deemed to be a sustainable transformation in the future based on normative visions from either North, South or Global perspectives. Our findings show that the literature landscape on explorative scenarios has significantly increased in the past ten years with most publications led by authors in the Global North. From the fraction of studies that describe desirable futures, visions highlight social, environmental and equity dimensions, but nuances were found between North and South. The visions that suggest the most transformative potential seek a more harmonious human-nature relationship and consider outcomes holistically, but only a fraction offer actual \u2018alternatives\u2019 to the status quo. We find that several gaps remain at the interface of biodiversity/ecosystems and justice, or the integration and impact of diverse knowledges and cultures. Addressing these in participatory, just and creative ways seems of utmost urgency. We hope this review can offer a glimpse of how futures-thinking can contribute to research and action on sustainability transformations, and the insights can inform and inspire future research.",

    "abstract": "The effects of climate change on marine ecosystems are causing cascading impacts on livelihood, food security, and culture through fisheries. Such impacts interact and exacerbate the effects of overfishing on marine social\u2010ecological systems, complicating the rebuilding of ecosystems to achieve desirable and sustainable ocean futures. Developing effective pathways for ecosystem rebuilding requires consideration of the co\u2010benefits and trade\u2010offs between ecological and social dimensions and between fishing sectors. However, the effects of intensifying climate change on such co\u2010benefits or trade\u2010offs are yet to be well understood, particularly in regions where ecosystem rebuilding is urgently needed. We applied a numerical optimization routine to define the scope for improvement toward the Pareto\u2010frontier for ecological robustness and economic benefits of the northern South China Sea (NSCS) and the East China Sea (ECS) ecosystems. These two ecosystems were used to represent over\u2010exploited low\u2010 and mid\u2010latitude systems, respectively, and the optimization aimed to improve their status through fisheries management. We find that the ECS ecosystem has the possibility of increasing the economic benefits generated by the fisheries it supports under climate change by 2050 while increasing the uncertainty of achieving biodiversity objectives. Nevertheless, climate change is projected to reduce the scope to restore ecosystem structures and the potential economic benefits in the NSCS ecosystem. This study highlights the contrasting impacts of climate change on the co\u2010benefits/trade\u2010offs in ecosystem rebuilding and the benefits obtainable by different fishing sectors even in neighboring ecosystems. We conclude that consideration at the nexus of climate\u2013biodiversity\u2010fisheries is a key to developing effective ecosystem rebuilding plan.",

The primary goal of this study was to assess the influence of COVID-19 on pond aquaculture in the Sunyani municipality, Ghana. To address this, the study used purposive and random sampling techniques to administer a semi-structured questionnaire to fifty (50) fish farmers. According to the survey, most respondents reported that the COVID-19 pandemic impacted pond aquaculture productivity, products, and farm operations. According to the respondents, the impact on pond aquaculture production was caused by the high cost of fingerlings, fish feed, and table-sized farmed fishes, as well as a scarcity of fingerlings, fish feed, and pharmaceutical supplies like lime. To avoid the pandemic's long-term damage, it is recommended that fish farmers should purchase pond aquaculture materials in bulk, including feed and pharmaceuticals.",

    "abstract": "Capture fisheries in many developing countries are overcapitalized and biologically overexploited, necessitating the promotion of aquaculture to mitigate the deficit in animal protein requirements, create jobs, reduce poverty, and improve the livelihoods of individuals and communities. Over the last two decades, total aquaculture output and its contribution to domestic fish production have surged, reaching 19% and 26% by 2021 (from 1% and 6% in 2000) in Ghana and Nigeria, respectively. The two main species cultivated are tilapia and catfish. While Nigeria is Africa\u2019s second-largest aquaculture producer, Ghana experienced the fastest growth in aquaculture production between 2006 and 2019. Despite the potential benefits, the sectors in both countries face critical challenges, including high feed costs and a lack of technical expertise. In addition, aquaculture can impose a negative externality on aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. As a result, aquaculture\u2019s social, economic, and environmental sustainability benefits are context and species-specific, hence an empirical conundrum. This study employs the Aquaculture Performance Indicators (APIs) for a comparative assessment of tilapia farms in Nigeria and Ghana. We found that the overall economic sustainability score is similar for both countries, but Ghana outperforms Nigeria marginally in social and environmental performance.",

    "abstract": "Effort expectancy and performance expectancy showed positive relationships with behavioural intention toward the use ofAhotoroven as IFST. Facilitating conditions showed a positive relationship with behavioural intention toward the use ofAhotoroven as IFST. Habits showed a positive relationship with behavioural intention toward the use ofAhotoroven as IFST). Hedonic motivation showed a positive relationship with behavioural intention toward the use ofAhotoroven as IFST. Social influence was found to be the dominant factor but negatively moderates the relationship between\u00a0habit and behavioural intention, leading to low adoption of theAhotoroven as IFST.AbstractPost-harvest losses and food safety concerns in the fish-processing sector have led to the development of improved fish-smoking technology (IFST) such as theAhotoroven in Ghana. Nevertheless, traditional fish-smoking ovens remain widely used in coastal communities. However, previous research has primarily focused on the scientific aspects of this issue, leaving a gap in understanding user perceptions and intentions from a behavioural perspective. To address this gap, a behavioural theoretical model, based on the revised unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT-2) adapted to the context of IFST was proposed in this study. This study aimed to unravel the driving factors influencing the behavioural intentions to use theAhotoroven. A survey was applied to 357 women engaged in fish smoking activity from five coastal communities in the Western and Central regions of Ghana and aware of theAhotor oven, and the theoretical model was subsequently tested using a partial least-squares structural equation model (PLS-SEM) analysis. Our findings revealed that social influence, effort expectancy, facilitation conditions, habits, hedonic motivation, and performance expectancy all had a direct impact on fishmongers' intention to use theAhotoroven. Social influence was found to be the dominant factor, but negatively moderates the relationship between habit and behavioural intention to use theAhotoroven. This means that social influence significantly dampens the established positive effect of habit on behavioural intention among fishmongers, leading to low adoption of theAhotoroven. These results provide valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders in the fisheries sector, enabling them to understand the behavioural factors that enablers and inhibitors influencing intention to use theAhotoroven improved fishsmoking technology (IFST), and to take necessary actions to improve its adoption among fishmongers in coastal communities.",

    "abstract": "Ocean warming is driving significant changes in the structure and functioning of marine ecosystems, shifting species' biogeography and phenology, changing body size and biomass and altering the trophodynamics of the system. Particularly, extreme temperature events such as marine heatwaves (MHWs) have been increasing in intensity, duration and frequency. MHWs are causing large\u2010scale impacts on marine ecosystems, such as coral bleaching, mass mortality of seagrass meadows and declines in fish stocks and other marine organisms in recent decades. In this study, we developed and applied a dynamic version of the EcoTroph trophodynamic modelling approach to study the cascading effects of individual MHW on marine ecosystem functioning. We simulated theoretical user\u2010controlled ecosystems and explored the consequences of various assumptions of marine species mortality along the food web, associated with different MHW intensities. We show that an MHW can lead to a significant biomass reduction of all consumers, with the severity of the declines being dependent on species trophic levels (TLs) and biomes, in addition to the characteristics of MHWs. Biomass of higher TLs declines more than lower TLs under an MHW, leading to changes in ecosystem structure. While tropical ecosystems are projected to be sensitive to low\u2010intensity MHWs, polar and temperate ecosystems are expected to be impacted by more intense MHWs. The estimated time to recover from MHW impacts is twice as long for polar ecosystems and one\u2010third longer for temperate biomes compared with tropical biomes. This study highlights the importance of considering extreme weather events in assessing the effects of climate change on the structures and functions of marine ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Shark is an important fishery commodity globally. However, 70 % decline in the populations of shark species has cast doubt on the fishery's economic success, especially in Ghana. Therefore, studying the shark fishery activities in Ghana from the perspectives of production, socio-economic, and management will inform key stakeholders of the approaches needed to strengthen the conservation of the fishery. We interviewed ninety-one (91) shark fishers from four important landing sites, namely; Apam, Dixcove, Tema, and Axim along the coast of Ghana using a semi-structured interview guide, and recorded their landings between April and December 2022. Our findings show that the dominant shark species landed by fishers were Sphyrna sp., C. leucas, C. carcahrias, R. acutus, C. carcharodon, I. oxyrinus, and Aliopas sp. with Sphyrna sp. and C. leucas experiencing a drastic population decline. Togo and China were the main foreign destinations for shark fin products, particularly fins of Sphyrna sp., C. leucas, and Aliopas sp. (species classified by the IUCN Red List as Endangered species). The price of shark fins during the lean season was significantly higher than in the peak period, indicating the influence of seasonality on the pricing of shark fins. The main challenges confronting shark fishing in Ghana were a decline in the population of sharks, inadequate premix fuel, and the risky nature of shark fishing activities. From the study, developing a species-specific conservation action plan through consultative approaches, community awareness programmes and enforcement of these conservation measures are some of the recommendations proposed.",

    "title": "Projecting contributions of marine protected areas to rebuild fish stocks under climate change",
    "abstract": "No-take marine protected areas (No-take MPAs) are considered as a major tool for conserving marine biodiversity and ecosystem services. No-take MPAs can also contribute to climate adaptation for exploited fish stocks. Meanwhile, many fish stocks in the world are overfished and management institutions are developing plans to rebuild them. Understanding the potential effects of no-take MPAs on fish stocks under climate change can help develop strategies for climate-resilient stock rebuilding. Here, using a linked climate-fish-fishing model, we undertake simulation experiments to examine the effects of no-take MPAs on biomass and potential catches of 231 exploited fish and invertebrate species in eight marine ecoregions in the Northeast Atlantic under climate change. The simulations include different levels of fishing, no-take MPAs coverage, atmospheric global warming levels, and account for the expected displacement of fishing to the area around the no-take MPAs. Average individual stock biomass is projected to decrease by 5\u201315% per degree Celsius atmospheric warming. Having 30% of the distribution of over-exploited fish stocks under no-take MPAs together with conservation-focused fisheries management of these stocks are projected to offset the negative impacts on their biomass under 2.6\u20132.9\u2009\u00b0C global warming. Meanwhile, potential catches increase when a portion of the over-exploited fish stocks is protected from fishing as higher biomass in the no-take MPAs spills-over to the surrounding areas. Our findings highlight that no-take MPAs, combined with reducing fishing intensity, can help rebuild over-exploited fish biomass and benefit their dependent fisheries in the Northeast Atlantic under projected climate change in the 21st century.",

    "abstract": "Climate change is causing persistent, widespread, and significant impacts on marine ecosystems which are predicted to interact and intensify. Overfishing and associated habitat degradation have put many fish populations and marine ecosystems at risk and is making the ocean more vulnerable to climate change and less capable of buffering against its effects. In this Perspective, we review how overfishing is disrupting the important role of marine vertebrates in the ocean carbon cycle, causing disturbance and damage to the carbon-rich seabed, and contributing to rising greenhouse gas emissions through fuel use. We discuss how implementing good fisheries management can reduce or remove many of the impacts associated with overfishing, including fish stock collapse, destruction of seabed habitats, provision of harmful subsidies and accompanying socio-economic impacts. Managing overfishing is one of the most effective strategies in protecting ocean carbon stores and can make an important contribution to climate mitigation and adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Being the world\u2019s largest seafood producer, China\u2019s mariculture is critical for ensuring national and global food security, yet greatly threatened by climate change. It is essential to assess the potential opportunities and challenges for Chinese mariculture in light of climate change. Although the impact of climate change on mariculture potential at a global scale has been investigated, studies at sub-national scales of China are scarce, particularly those that take into account multiple environmental stressors and species. Here, we applied a combination of physical and biological models to quantify the spatiotemporal variation in the mariculture potential of seven finfish species and seven bivalve species cultured in China under the emission scenarios SSP5-8.5 and SSP1-2.6 in the twentyfirst century. Our results demonstrated that the spatiotemporal trends in culture potential was species-specific. Finfish was less affected than bivalves. Four finfish species and seven bivalve species showed a continuously declining trend in culture potential and most species showed a northward shift of the centroid with high growth potential under SSP5-8.5. Under the scenario SSP1-2.6, the culture potential of finfish species mostly showed a stable or increasing trend, while that of bivalve species declined in the mid-twentyfirst century and partially recovered in the late twentyfirst century. Cold-water species exhibited a greater loss of culture potential than warm-water and eurythermal species. In the SSP5-8.5 and SSP1-2.6 scenarios, the cold-water species Oncorhynchus mykiss and Patinopecten yessoensis experienced the most significant loss in culture potential among finfish and bivalve species. Meanwhile, the culture potential for two out of the four warm-water species, specifically Epinephelus spp. and Sciaenops ocellatus, saw an increase. The culture potential for eight eurythermal species remained stable or declined. This study helps to identify mariculture potential for different species and sea areas and can inform the development of climate-resilient mariculture in China.",

    "abstract": "Seafood is an important source of bioavailable micronutrients supporting human health, yet it is unclear how micronutrient production has changed in the past or how climate change will influence its availability. Here combining reconstructed fisheries databases and predictive models, we assess nutrient availability from fisheries and mariculture in the past and project their futures under climate change. Since the 1990s, availabilities of iron, calcium and omega-3 from seafood for direct human consumption have increased but stagnated for protein. Under climate change, nutrient availability is projected to decrease disproportionately in tropical low-income countries that are already highly dependent on seafood-derived nutrients. At 4\u00b0C of warming, nutrient availability is projected to decline by ~30% by 2100 in low income countries, while at 1.5\u00b0C warming, decreases are projected to be ~10%. We demonstrate the importance of effective mitigation to support nutritional security of vulnerable nations and global health equity.",

Their livelihoods, identities and well-being have traditionally relied on lands and natural resources, and the regions they inhabit are susceptible to extreme weather events such as heatwaves, droughts, heavy rainfall and the thawing of permafrost. Indigenous Peoples are on the front line of the climate crisis, despite having contributed little to global emissions. These communities have lived in close relationships with their environments for thousands of years, developing sustainable ways of life, protecting natural ecosystems and adapting to changes such as climate variations and human-made disasters. Indigenous cultures, traditions and spirituality are connected to their environment. Invasions, colonizations, land dispossession and, in some cases, forced migrations have led to many Indigenous communities losing their rights, facing poverty and living in vulnerable regions with reduced capacities to adapt to the climate crisis. The confluence of these factors means that Indigenous Peoples are uniquely placed to provide sustainable adaptations to mitigate the climate crisis, drawing on their bodies of knowledge, ontologies, practices, ethical values, beliefs and traditions that have been passed down through generations. Today, almost 500 million people \u2014 around 6% of the global population \u2014 are members of Indigenous groups, including the authors. Indigenous Peoples steward more than one-quarter of lands around the globe, which contain 80% of Earth\u2019s remaining biodiversity.",
